# aba-graph-embedding

__aba_graph folder__ :       
* aba_graph.py : allow user to create and visualize ABA graphs from a json file (the folder "json" contains some examples)  

* The data folder contains the main Dataset "data_reviews.xlsx" and a Verification folder containing the files used to do edge mining  

* xlsx_data_to_json.py : allow generating simple ABA graphs from the Dataset "data_reviews"  
* enrich.py : using Verification files to draw some edges on the previous generated graphs   
* gen_graph.py : create graph regroup by their topics from the graph created before  
* The models folder is containing :   
1. util.py : convert graphs into a .tsv file   
2. transE.py and rotatE.py : training these models on the .tsv file (with PyKeen)  


__emb_tech folder__ :   
* data folder with some classical datasets for testing graph embedding techniques   
* models folder containing impl√©mentations from scratch of embedding techniques
